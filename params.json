{"name":"Bootswatch-sass","tagline":"Bootswatch ported from Less to Sass.","body":"# [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) forked by [Victor Potasso](http://victorpotasso.com)\r\n[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)\r\n\r\nI think most of all developers are now working with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) instead of [Less](http://lesscss.org/) including myself. Thus I decided to porting Bootswatch to Sass. It was first made by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and now you can take advantage from it on [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com).\r\n\r\n* Source: [github.com/victorpotasso/bootswatch-sass](https://github.com/victorpotasso/bootswatch-sass)\r\n* Preview: [bootswatchsass.victorpotasso.com](http://bootswatchsass.victorpotasso.com)\r\n* Home Page: [victorpotasso.com/](http://www.victorpotasso.com)\r\n* Twitter: [@victorpotasso](https://twitter.com/victorpotasso)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n+ Ported Bootswatch from LESS to SASS.\r\n+ Task *watch-themes* added.\r\n+ Using [preprocess](https://github.com/jsoverson/grunt-preprocess) to provide theme's index.html\r\n+ Created [themes.json](https://github.com/victorpotasso/bootswatch-sass/blob/master/themes.json) file to control which theme will be compiled and also its title and description.\r\n+ Directories was rearranged.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nIf you haven't used [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki) guide, as it explains how to create a [gruntfile](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki) as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, installs the dependences with this command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\nVictor Potasso           \r\n\r\n+ http://github.com/victorpotasso\r\n+ http://victorpotasso.com\r\n+ http://bootswatchsass.victorpotasso.com\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\n+ [Mark Otto](http://github.com/markdotto) and [Jacob Thornton](http://github.com/fat) for [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap).\r\n+ [Thomas Park](http://github.com/thomaspark) for [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com)\r\n+ [jQuery Team](http://jquery.com/) for [jQuery Team](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) Â© [Victor Potasso](http://victorpotasso.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
