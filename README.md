What is it?
-----------
[Bootswatch Sass](http://bootswatchsass.victorpotasso.com/) is a conversion of [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) from Less to Sass.

Changes
-------

+ Ported Bootswatch from LESS to SASS.
+ Task *watch-themes* added.
+ Using [preprocess](https://github.com/jsoverson/grunt-preprocess) to provide theme's index.html
+ Created [themes.json](https://github.com/victorpotasso/bootswatch-sass/blob/master/themes.json) file to control which theme will be compiled and also its title and description.
+ Directories was rearranged.

Getting Started
---------------

If you haven't used [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki) guide, as it explains how to create a [gruntfile](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki) as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, installs the dependences with this command:

```shell
$ npm install
```
